Hello and welcome to my website!

My name is Arushi Kothari and I am currently working at Johnson & Johnson.

I like to describe myself as a marketing enthusiast and I primarily use this blog to write about marketing concepts or advertisements that I find interesting. I also enjoy writing about instances from my life that leave a deep impact on me.

Apart from writing, I love creating and editing videos! I have documented all my past work <a href="/my-work/"> here</a>.

Get in touch with me: contact@arushikothari.com
